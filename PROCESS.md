# 07-06-2018

## Done:
- filtered data for missing values in essential data
- made bar chart
- made scatter plot
- made update function for scatter when clicked on bar
- colored bar chart, i colored it depending on amount of findings per year to better clarify the differences. 
- implemented navigation bar, this way it seems like a real webpage. Also not all the text and graphs are together, which makes te website more user friendly. 

## To do:
- fix ticks on x-axis bar chart
- think of what to do with outliers scatter plot
- gather needed data in usable datastructure for area diagram and finish it (started already)
- link area diagram with scatter plot
- color scatters in scatter plot

## Problems:
- thinking of what way is easy to gather relevant data per year for methods usage

# 08-06-2018

## Done:
- created a button

## To do:
- Transition scatters when updated
- find variables for size of scatters and colors.
- link button to update function y axis

## Problems:
- Linking button to function to update one axis. Might have to update both the axis, not just the y axis. Look if axis can get id's

# 11-06-2018

## Done:
- Started working on polar area diagram
- started y axis info update, using "planet" for tipic to make the code use ["angular_distance"] instead of ["star_distance"]

## To do:


## Problems:
- linking data to my polar area diagram. 
- i am not sure if the way my scatter plot function is made now i can seperately update my y-axis. 
- draw scatters reads planetsyear[i] as [object object]

# 12-06-2018
## Done:
- axis updating per year for scatter plot
- graph update on different subject
- coloured scatters on eccentricity, sized them on radius (if available)

## To do:
- thinking of what to do with outliers on scatter plot
- put titles on scatter plots

## Problems: 
- outliers in data make the axis disporportianate
- clicking of different years when swithced from topic

# 13-06-2018
## Done:
- title to scatter plot
- button for highlighting planets
