## Done:
- filtered data for missing values in essential data
- made bar chart
- made scatter plot
- made update function for scatter when clicked on bar
- colored bar chart, i colored it depending on amount of findings per year to better clarify the differences. 
- implemented navigation bar, this way it seems like a real webpage. Also not all the text and graphs are together, which makes te website more user friendly. 

## To do:
- fix ticks on x-axis bar chart
- think of what to do with outliers scatter plot
- gather needed data in usable datastructure for area diagram and finish it (started already)
- link area diagram with scatter plot
- color scatters in scatter plot

## Problems:
- thinking of what way is easy to gather relevant data per year for methods usage
