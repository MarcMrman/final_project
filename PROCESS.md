## Done:
- filtered data for missing values in essential data
- made bar chart
- made scatter plot
- made update function for scatter when clicked on bar
- colored bar chart, i colored it depending on amount of findings per year to better clarify the differences. 
- implemented navigation bar, this way it seems like a real webpage. Also not all the text and graphs are together, which makes te website more user friendly. 

## To do:
- fix ticks on x-axis bar chart
- think of what to do with outliers scatter plot
- gather needed data in usable datastructure for area diagram and finish it (started already)
- link area diagram with scatter plot
- color scatters in scatter plot

## Problems:
- thinking of what way is easy to gather relevant data per year for methods usage

# 08-06-2018

## Done:
- created a button

## To do:
- Transition scatters when updated
- find variables for size of scatters and colors.
- link button to update function y axis

## Problems:
- Linking button to function to update one axis. Might have to update both the axis, not just the y axis. Look if axis can get id's

## Done:
- Started working on polar area diagram
- started y axis info update, using "planet" for tipic to make the code use ["angular_distance"] instead of ["star_distance"]

## To do:


## Problems:
- linking data to my polar area diagram.
